IMPORTANT GAMEPLAY INFO:

THIS GAME IS VERY, VERY EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT, SO EXPECT A LOT OF BUGS.

there is no tutorial (yet) lol so take these following pieces of information into mind.

When you pick up a gun, you need to use the trigger button on your offhand to grab a piece of ammo. You can grab a piece of ammo from the ammo zone at the left side of your hip. The ammo zone ONLY APPEARS WHEN YOURE HOLDING A GUN.

Most guns require you racking back a slide or a pump to chamber a bullet. After inserting a magazine, be sure to use the trigger button to pull back the slide.

This game has a bunch of useable magical abilities that are casted through gestures: movement based hand motions. You can learn these gestures and abilities in-game.
